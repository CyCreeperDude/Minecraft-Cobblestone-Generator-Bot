# Minecraft-Cobblestone-Generator-Bot
I made a bot with Python and the module PyAutoGui for collecting from cobblestone generators in the popular video game Minecraft. It continuously holds down left click while scrolling between all of your hotbar slots. Should have a full hotbar of pickaxes to work.
